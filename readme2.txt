Compile & Run:
1. Unzip the source file
2. on the command line, type "make";
3. to run all 3 programs at once, on the command line type "make fullRun"
4. to run individually, type: "./program2 <filex.txt> <filey.txt> <output2.txt>"


Data Structures:
This used a recursive function without memoization. It does not use any data structures

Timing:
Timing begins after the creation of the vector and ends after the algorithm. the writing of output is not included in timing, nor is any other I/O calls

time complexity: Exponential (really bad solution)

classes used:
program2.cpp
 - contains source code
